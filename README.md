gps_denied
==========

gps_denied is a computer vision project that uses feature matching to identify which map tile corresponds to a query image. By using the ORB detector and BFMatcher, the project compares the query image with a collection of images (tiles) and determines which one has the highest number of matches.

Installation
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Requirements:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- OpenCV (the opencv-python package)
- NumPy

Installing Dependencies:
To install the required packages, run:
    pip install opencv-python numpy

Cloning the Repository:
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory:
    git clone https://github.com/troveski/gps_denied.git
    cd gps_denied

How It Works
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Feature Detection:
   - The script uses ORB to detect up to 5000 keypoints in both the query image (e.g., "marcus.png") and in each tile located in the "roma" folder.

2. Feature Matching:
   - For each image (tile) in the "roma" folder, descriptors are computed and compared to the query image descriptors using BFMatcher (with crossCheck enabled).
   - The matches are sorted by distance, where smaller distances indicate better matches.

3. Best Match Selection:
   - The script identifies which image in the folder has the highest number of matches and draws the matching keypoints.
   - The results are saved in a folder called "matching_results", so you can review or share them later.

4. Output:
   - Each processed image will have a file saved showing the top 20 matches.
   - The image with the highest number of matches (the best match) is also saved and highlighted.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Usage
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Place your query image (e.g., "marcus.png") in the project root directory.
2. Make sure that the "roma" folder contains the map tiles (images) to be compared.
3. Run the script:
       python get_images.py

After running the script, the results will be saved in the "matching_results" folder.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Example
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Below is an example of the final output:

    The image on the left is the query image, and the image on the right is the tile that obtained the best matching, with the matching keypoints drawn.

Example Best Matching Output:
File: matching_results/best_match_tile_example.png

Note: Update the example image path according to the file generated by the script.
